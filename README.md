# circles

### Live site: https://canvas-circles.surge.sh

A fun project built with HTML Canvas. Control the number, speed, and size of animated circles bouncing around the screen. Shout-out to the tutorial series [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL) for the excellent introduction to how the ```<canvas>``` element works! Built with HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JS (ES2015).

#### Goals of this project:

- Build something cool with HTML5 Canvas
- Make a sleek, custom layout despite working with the extremely stubborn `input` elements
- Get some practice with the OOP using pure JavaScript

#### Local installation:

To run this locally on your machine, simply clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
