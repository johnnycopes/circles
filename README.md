# circles

A fun project built with HTML Canvas. Control the number, speed, and size of animated circles bouncing around the screen. Shout-out to the tutorial series [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL) for the excellent introduction to how the element works!

## Local installation

To run this locally on your machine, simply clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:

## Built With

* HTML5 Canvas
